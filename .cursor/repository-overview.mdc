# Repository Overview

This is a personal dotfiles repository containing configuration files and setup scripts for a macOS development environment.

## Tech Stack & Dependencies

- **Shell**: ZSH with Oh-My-ZSH and Powerlevel10k theme
- **Runtime Management**: mise (replacing nvm, rbenv, etc.)
- **Package Management**: yarn (auto-installed with new Node versions) 
- **Keyboard Customization**: Karabiner-Elements with goku (.edn compilation)
- **System Automation**: Hammerspoon for advanced input handling and system control

### Key Dependencies
- [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
- [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)
- [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)
- [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) (runtime version manager)

## Repository Structure

- `/scripts/`: Utility scripts for environment setup
- `/home/`: Dotfiles and configuration files that get symlinked to home directory
- `/home/.config/`: Configuration files for various applications
- `/home/.hammerspoon/`: Hammerspoon automation scripts
- `/.cursor/`: Documentation for agentic sessions

## Critical Dependencies

**Karabiner â†” Hammerspoon Interdependency**: 
- Hammerspoon must be running for Karabiner's `multitouch_extension_finger_count_total` to work
- Without Hammerspoon: trackpad finger count detection fails, movement_mode doesn't activate
- This is required for the enhanced scrolling system to function properly
