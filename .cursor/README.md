## Usage for Agentic Sessions

These files provide structured context for AI coding assistants:

1. **Quick Start**: Read `repository-overview.mdc` for basic understanding
2. **Commands**: Reference `scripts-and-commands.mdc` for available tools
3. **Workflow**: Follow `workflow-guide.mdc` for proper procedures
4. **Issues**: Check `troubleshooting.mdc` for known problems
5. **Decisions**: Review `architecture-decisions.mdc` for context on why things work the way they do

## Migration from CLAUDE.md

This structured approach replaces the single `CLAUDE.md` file with organized, focused documentation that's easier to maintain and reference during coding sessions.
